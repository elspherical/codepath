## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite applications:
- Instagram
  * Easy to view and share many different types of videos
  * Can easily make large group chats
  * Variety of response options to posts and stories
- Discord
  * Can make large servers with a large variety of functionalities
  * Has many useful bots to assist with server management
- Find My
  * Live locations are very accurate
  * Has useful safety features such as being notified when someone reaches a certain location
- Lens Buddy
  * Allows users to take timed photos; useful when there is not a photographer present
  * Can select which photos to upload to main photo album
  * Users can customize how much time they want between photos, etc. (very customizable)

App idea: 
Currently on Instagram, if a user makes a post, it appears on their followers' feeds (recommended posts to view). However, if a user wants to have a post appear on their profiles (usually for personal memories) but not in their followers' feeds, they would have to perform a trick where they archive the post immediately after posting, wait a few days, and then unarchive it. It would much easier if there were a built-in feature to do exactly this: have a different mode for posting that bridges the gap between archiving a post and publicly posting it. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. <br> <br>
It was definitely difficult to start learning Swift because I had not used Xcode before. After completing the tutorial, I implemented the following features:
- changed the colors and fonts of the text
- added a button "change name color" that changes the color of my name at the top of the app to different shades of green.
It was also challenging to extend what I had learned to the new button, but it was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge.
